First of all, here's the default attribute set.

	[MENT_ATT_RANGE:SOCIAL_AWARENESS:200:800:900:1000:1100:1300:5000]

One may notice that these are not actually the defaults. Rather, the top end has been set to 5000 across the board, mostly because it allows for "heros" better.

What attributes correspond to which TES attributes is flexible, but here's a rule of thumb (bolded items are considered "more pertinent", the rest are take-or-leave):

Strength: **STRENGTH**, AGILITY
Intelligence: **ANALYTICAL ABILITY**, FOCUS, PATIENCE, MEMORY
Willpower: **WILLPOWER**, FOCUS, INTUITION
Agility: **KINESTHETIC_SENSE**, SPATIAL_SENSE
Speed: **AGILITY**
Endurance: **TOUGHNESS**, **ENDURANCE**, RECUPERATION
Personality: **SOCIAL_AWARENESS**, EMPATHY, MUSICALITY, LINGUISTIC_ABILITY
Luck: None

DISEASE_RESISTANCE applies to those who are literally disease-resistant. The flexibility comes in with flavor, and one (i.e. I) shouldn't feel beholden to these things. These are not 1:1 mappings by any means, either, and the non-bold ones can basically be applied willy-nilly, even if it contradicts (e.g. dunmer have higher intuition/focus, despite lower willpower)

Elves are considered to have long lives. The exact details of this are [somewhat contradicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/cs7c7j/your_definitive_thread_on_elven_lifespans/), but I'm using that linked post (and the comments in the replies, of course, this *is* TES lore) as a guideline: they live at *least* 300 years, but can live for much longer. Since they have longer lifespans, they have different skill learn rates (very slightly slower) and different physical/mental attribute rates (slower gain, slower atrophy). This is all in a neat little creature variation so I don't have to copy+paste as much.
