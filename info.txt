[DESCRIPTION:The formulas of proper Velothi magic continue in ancient tradition, but that virility is dead, by which I mean at least replaced.]

[STEAM_TITLE:Vvardenfell (Elder Scrolls Mod)]
[STEAM_DESCRIPTION:This is a total conversion mod. I primarily made it as a sort of tutorial for such things, showing how to patch existing mods, add new graphics based on existing ones and so on. The title, "Vvardenfell", means "Shield City" or "City of the Strong Shield" in dwemeris; in other words, it's the closest thing to "Dwarf Fortress" in the dwarven language. Any resemblance to actual landmasses in The Elder Scrolls games is purely coincidental. Vanilla metals have been rebalanced; brass is now usable to make armor/weapons, steel is vanilla iron and iron just sucks now. The new metals are not terribly uncommon. If you're playing as dwemer, you can make brass and iron into much stronger forms. Obviously all of the playable races from the main series games have been implemented; I may make orsimer and nords playable, at some point, since they both have pretty dwarfy stuff going for them. Cliff racers are the only animals I could cobble together graphics for; I can't sprite well. All civilized creatures have graphics, though khajiit and especially argonian graphics are pretty obviously placeholder-ish. There's far, far more civilizations than in vanilla, so expect some interesting politics in your legends mode. Dragons have been reworked, of course; they use the Thu'um now, and the Thu'um is a secret that can be learned like necromancy. You can also get some shouts as a blessing in adventure mode. Other than that, it's a bit barebones.]
